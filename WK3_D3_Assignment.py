# Final Exercise:

# Create a Move_Tutor Class that inherits from the Pokemon parent class.Â¶
# This class should have a list attribute (move_list) that holds pokemon moves which should be populated with an api call to the PokeApi moves section (just like we did with abilities and types in the Pokemon class example). Finally create a class method that teaches your pokemon up to 4 moves. This method should take in a user input to what move they would like to teach and do a membership inside the move_list. If the move exists inside the move_list the pokemon can learn that move and append to the final taught_moves list.

# grab all the names of the moves from the list and grab a giant list of the moves that the pokemon can learn
# take in user input that asks which move you want to teach your pokemon
# is that move inside that list?
# if not, then display 'can't learn that move'
# if they reach max moves, maybe a functionality that lets you replaces moves already learned
# grab move stats and save to a dictionary
